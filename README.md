# Message Board

#### By _**Nicole Sanders**_

This web application allows users to view questions posted on a message board and lets users comment on questions.


## Planning

1. Configuration/dependencies
  * Dependencies can be found in the bower.json and package.json files.

2. Specs
  * Create index page with component to display the question and author name.
  Input: "How do I crack eggs? -Jane Doe"
  Output: Displays question and author
  * Create a form for a user to enter a new question which is then shown on the homepage.
  * Create a page for individual questions where the user can view more information about the question.
  * Allow users to comment on the question.
  Input: "You crack an egg by lightly tapping it on a table and pulling the shell apart at the crack. - John Smith"

3. Integration
  * Initial routes or index pages with all dependencies in Controller/index.html head
  * Template/html page for the index page
  * Template/html page for individual question pages

4. UX/UI
  * Use CSS and Bootstrap to style the page
